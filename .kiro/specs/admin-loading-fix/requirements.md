# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the persistent loading state ("Yuklanmoqda...") that appears when users enter the admin panel. The current implementation shows loading indicators for too long due to multiple Suspense fallbacks and inefficient data fetching, creating a poor user experience. The goal is to optimize the loading behavior to provide immediate access to the admin interface while data loads in the background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see a smooth Telegram-style loading animation when entering the admin panel, so that I have a polished and familiar loading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to any admin route THEN the system SHALL show a Telegram-style loading animation with skeleton placeholders
2. WHEN the admin interface loads THEN it SHALL display animated skeleton screens that mimic the final layout structure
3. WHEN the sidebar and main content load THEN they SHALL appear with smooth fade-in transitions similar to Telegram
4. WHEN data becomes available THEN skeleton placeholders SHALL smoothly transition to real content with fade animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see specific loading indicators for individual data sections, so that I know which parts are still loading and which are ready to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN statistics cards SHALL show individual loading states while the rest of the interface remains interactive
2. WHEN navigating between admin sections THEN only the content area SHALL show loading states, not the entire page layout
3. WHEN data is being fetched THEN loading indicators SHALL be contextual and specific to the data being loaded
4. WHEN multiple data sources are loading THEN each SHALL have independent loading states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the admin interface to load progressively, so that I can start using available features while other data continues to load in the background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering the admin panel THEN the layout and navigation SHALL render immediately
2. WHEN data fetching is in progress THEN users SHALL be able to navigate between different admin sections
3. WHEN switching between admin pages THEN previously loaded data SHALL remain available without re-showing loading states
4. IF network requests are slow THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive and usable for non-data-dependent features
