# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to add product variants (such as size, color, material, etc.) through the admin panel. These variants should be properly saved to the database and displayed in the product detail view for customers to select from. This enhances the product catalog by allowing multiple options for a single product.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to add variants (size, color, etc.) to products in the admin panel, so that customers can choose from different options when viewing product details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the product management section THEN the system SHALL display an interface to add product variants
2. WHEN an administrator adds a new variant type (e.g., "Size", "Color") THEN the system SHALL allow entering multiple values for that variant
3. WHEN an administrator saves product variants THEN the system SHALL store the variant data in the database
4. WHEN variant data is saved THEN the system SHALL validate that variant names and values are not empty
5. WHEN an administrator views an existing product THEN the system SHALL display all previously saved variants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see and select product variants in the product detail view, so that I can choose the specific version of the product I want.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer opens a product detail view THEN the system SHALL display all available variants for that product
2. WHEN variants are available THEN the system SHALL show them as selectable options (dropdowns, buttons, or similar UI elements)
3. WHEN a customer selects a variant THEN the system SHALL update the product display accordingly
4. WHEN no variants are available THEN the system SHALL display the product normally without variant selection
5. WHEN a customer selects different variant combinations THEN the system SHALL maintain the selection state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system, I want to properly store and retrieve variant data, so that the feature works reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variant data is submitted from the admin panel THEN the system SHALL save it to the MongoDB database
2. WHEN the frontend requests product data THEN the system SHALL include variant information in the API response
3. WHEN variant data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct data structure and types
4. WHEN the database is queried for products THEN the system SHALL efficiently fetch variant data without performance issues
5. WHEN variant data is updated THEN the system SHALL properly synchronize changes between admin panel and frontend display
