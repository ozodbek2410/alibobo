# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the e-commerce platform into a high-performance application that matches the speed and user experience of modern online marketplaces like Uzum, Amazon, and AliExpress. The current implementation suffers from slow API responses, inefficient data fetching, large bundle sizes, unoptimized images, and poor caching strategies. The goal is to implement comprehensive performance optimizations across frontend (React), backend (Node.js + MongoDB), and infrastructure layers to achieve instant navigation, fast loading times, and smooth user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want product detail pages to load instantly when navigating from product grids, so that I can browse products as smoothly as on Amazon or AliExpress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a product card THEN the product detail page SHALL load within 200ms using cached data
2. WHEN navigating to product details THEN the system SHALL use dedicated React Router routes instead of modal-only approach
3. WHEN product data is already cached THEN the system SHALL display content immediately without loading skeletons
4. WHEN product images are displayed THEN they SHALL be optimized (WebP/AVIF) and load with lazy loading
5. WHEN users navigate back from product details THEN the previous grid state SHALL be preserved without re-fetching

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want search and filtering to respond instantly without delays, so that I can find products efficiently like on modern marketplaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL debounce requests to avoid excessive API calls
2. WHEN applying filters THEN old requests SHALL be cancelled using AbortController when new ones are triggered
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL be cached for 5 minutes to avoid repeated identical requests
4. WHEN users type quickly THEN the system SHALL throttle requests to maximum 1 per 300ms
5. WHEN network requests are pending THEN previous results SHALL remain visible until new ones arrive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load progressively with minimal bundle sizes, so that the initial page load is as fast as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN admin panel code SHALL NOT be included in the regular user bundle
2. WHEN large components load THEN they SHALL use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting
3. WHEN CSS is built THEN unused Tailwind classes SHALL be purged to minimize bundle size
4. WHEN JavaScript bundles are analyzed THEN they SHALL be under 500KB for the main user bundle
5. WHEN components are lazy-loaded THEN they SHALL show appropriate loading states during import

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to load quickly and efficiently, so that product browsing feels smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product images are uploaded THEN they SHALL be automatically converted to WebP/AVIF formats
2. WHEN images are displayed in grids THEN they SHALL use loading="lazy" attribute for performance
3. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL be delivered via CDN with appropriate caching headers
4. WHEN responsive images are needed THEN the system SHALL serve different sizes based on device/viewport
5. WHEN images fail to load THEN fallback placeholders SHALL be displayed gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API responses to be fast and efficient, so that users experience minimal loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN pagination with limits SHALL always be applied (default: 20 items)
2. WHEN database queries execute THEN they SHALL use proper indexes for frequently queried fields
3. WHEN frequently requested data is accessed THEN it SHALL be served from Redis cache with 1-5 minute TTL
4. WHEN heavy operations are triggered THEN they SHALL be moved to background queues (BullMQ/RabbitMQ)
5. WHEN API responses are sent THEN they SHALL include appropriate caching headers for browser caching

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to feel responsive even during data loading, so that I can continue browsing while content loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN skeleton screens SHALL disappear quickly due to background caching
2. WHEN multiple API calls are made THEN identical requests SHALL be deduplicated and cached
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the interface SHALL remain interactive during background data fetching
4. WHEN cached data exists THEN it SHALL be displayed immediately while fresh data loads in background
5. WHEN loading states are shown THEN they SHALL be contextual and specific to the loading content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work efficiently across all devices and network conditions, so that performance is consistent regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is served THEN gzip/brotli compression SHALL be enabled on the server
2. WHEN static assets are requested THEN they SHALL have long-term caching headers (1 year)
3. WHEN the application loads THEN critical CSS SHALL be inlined and non-critical CSS lazy-loaded
4. WHEN on slow networks THEN the application SHALL prioritize critical content loading first
5. WHEN browser caching is available THEN it SHALL be leveraged for API responses and static assets
