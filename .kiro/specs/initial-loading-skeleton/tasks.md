  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Enhance useOptimizedFetch hook for better loading states


  - Modify hook to properly indicate initial loading state even with cached data

- [ ] 5. Add error handling for skeleton states
  - Implement error state handling that properly hides skeleton on API errors
  - Add retry functionality that shows skeleton during retry attempts
  - Create appropriate error messages when skeleton disappears due to errors
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Test skeleton functionality across different scenarios
  - Write tests for initial page load skeleton display
  - Test skeleton behavior when changing categories and search queries
  - Verify skeleton works correctly with cached vs fresh API data
  - Test responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
