# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Replace circular dots with progress lines in ModernProductCard


  - Update the image navigation UI from circular dots to horizontal progress lines
  - Position progress lines at the bottom of the image area with proper spacing
  - Ensure progress lines span the full width with equal distribution
  - Style active progress line with primary-orange color and inactive with gray
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_



- [ ] 2. Implement hover zone visual feedback indicators
  - Add subtle gradient overlays to show left and right hover zones
  - Display gradients only on hover for products with multiple images
  - Use semi-transparent black gradients (from-black/5 to-transparent)


  - Position gradients to cover left and right halves of the image area
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Enhance mouse event handling for image navigation
  - Update handleMouseMove function to properly detect left/right zones


  - Implement 50% width split for navigation zones
  - Add boundary checks to prevent navigation beyond first/last images
  - Maintain existing hover delay functionality (800ms)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.4_



- [ ] 4. Update progress line click navigation
  - Modify handleDotClick to work with progress line elements
  - Ensure click events properly stop propagation
  - Update ARIA labels for accessibility compliance
  - Test click navigation with different image counts


  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Add responsive design support for progress lines
  - Ensure progress lines scale appropriately on mobile devices
  - Test hover functionality on touch devices


  - Implement touch-friendly navigation alternatives for mobile
  - Verify consistent spacing and sizing across screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Implement error handling and edge cases



  - Handle products with no images gracefully
  - Add fallback behavior for single image products
  - Test image loading error scenarios
  - Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.5_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive testing for navigation functionality
  - Write unit tests for hover zone detection logic
  - Test boundary conditions (first/last image navigation)
  - Create integration tests for parent component callbacks
  - Test accessibility features with screen readers
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Optimize performance and smooth transitions
  - Ensure smooth opacity transitions for progress lines
  - Optimize image transition animations
  - Test performance with products having many images
  - Implement proper state cleanup on component unmount
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_
