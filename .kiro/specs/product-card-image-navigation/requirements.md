## Introduction

This feature enhances the product card component with intuitive image navigation functionality. Users will be able to navigate through multiple product images by hovering over different areas of the product card, similar to the craftsmen card functionality. The feature includes visual progress indicators showing the current image position and total number of images.

2. WHEN a product has only one image THEN the system SHALL NOT display progress indicators
3. WHEN displaying progress indicators THEN the system SHALL show the current image position highlighted differently from other indicators
4. WHEN displaying progress indicators THEN the system SHALL show the total number of images available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing a product card, I want to navigate through product images by hovering over different areas of the card, so that I can quickly preview all available images without clicking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user hovers over the right half of the product image THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next image
2. WHEN user hovers over the left half of the product image THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous image
3. WHEN user is on the first image and hovers left THEN the system SHALL remain on the first image
4. WHEN user is on the last image and hovers right THEN the system SHALL remain on the last image
5. WHEN user moves mouse away from the product card THEN the system SHALL reset hover state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating product images, I want smooth transitions and visual feedback, so that the navigation feels responsive and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between images THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transition animations
2. WHEN hovering over navigation areas THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the hover zones
3. WHEN changing images THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicators to reflect the current position
4. WHEN hovering over different areas THEN the system SHALL implement a delay to prevent rapid image switching

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the image navigation to work consistently across desktop and mobile, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using on desktop THEN the system SHALL support hover-based navigation
2. WHEN using on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly navigation alternatives
3. WHEN displaying on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate sizing for progress indicators
