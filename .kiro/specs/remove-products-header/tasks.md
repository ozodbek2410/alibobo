# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove the Results Header section from ProductsGrid component


  - Locate and delete the entire "Results Header" JSX block in ProductsGrid.jsx
  - Remove the section that displays product count, search context, and filter clearing options
  - Ensure the products grid appears directly after the category filter section
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Test the layout and functionality after header removal



  - Verify the products grid displays correctly without the header section
  - Test all filtering functionality (category, search, price range, sorting) still works
  - Confirm the layout flows properly from category filters to products grid
  - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.2_
