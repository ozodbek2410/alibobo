# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the "Barcha mahsulotlar" (All products) header section from the products grid page. The section currently displays product count information and filter clearing options, but the user wants it completely removed to simplify the interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the products header section removed so that the interface is cleaner and more focused on the actual products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the products page loads THEN the "Barcha mahsulotlar" header section SHALL NOT be displayed
2. WHEN filtering products THEN the results header with count information SHALL NOT be shown
3. WHEN searching for products THEN the search results header SHALL NOT be displayed
4. WHEN the page renders THEN the products grid SHALL appear directly after the filter controls without any header section

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the filter clearing functionality to remain accessible so that I can still reset my filters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filters are applied THEN the filter clearing functionality SHALL remain available through existing filter controls
2. WHEN the header is removed THEN no existing filter functionality SHALL be broken
3. WHEN users need to clear filters THEN they SHALL be able to do so through the individual filter controls
