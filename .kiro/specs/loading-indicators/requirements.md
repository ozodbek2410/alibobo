# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement loading indicators throughout the application to provide better user experience while data is being fetched. Currently, users see empty states or no feedback while products, craftsmen, and other data are loading, which can be confusing. The loading indicators will show users that the application is actively working to load content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators when products are being fetched, so that I know the application is working and content is coming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner in the products section
2. WHEN products are being searched or filtered THEN the system SHALL show a loading state in the products grid
3. WHEN the loading is complete THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and show the products
4. IF there are no products found THEN the system SHALL show the "Mahsulotlar yo'q" message instead of loading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators when craftsmen data is being loaded, so that I understand the page is still loading content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator in the craftsmen section
2. WHEN craftsmen data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator and display the craftsmen
3. IF craftsmen data fails to load THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent loading indicators across the application, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data fetching occurs THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading spinner design
2. WHEN loading states are active THEN the system SHALL prevent user interactions that could cause conflicts
3. WHEN multiple sections are loading simultaneously THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators for each section independently
4. WHEN loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL maintain the loading state until completion or error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want loading indicators to be accessible and performant, so that all users can understand the loading state regardless of their abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading indicators are shown THEN the system SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers
2. WHEN loading states change THEN the system SHALL announce the changes to assistive technologies
3. WHEN loading indicators are displayed THEN the system SHALL not impact page performance significantly
4. WHEN users navigate away during loading THEN the system SHALL properly cancel ongoing requests
