  - Add support for custom loading messages and children components
  - Implement interaction prevention during loading states
  - Create smooth show/hide animations with proper z-index management
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Integrate loading indicators in MainPage component
  - Modify MainPage component to use loading states from useParallelFetch hook
  - Add loading indicators for products and craftsmen sections during initial page load
  - Implement conditional rendering to show loading skeletons when data is not available
  - Ensure loading states are properly managed for parallel data fetching
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Integrate loading indicators in ProductsGrid component
  - Modify ProductsGrid component to show loading skeleton during product fetching
  - Add loading states for search and filter operations using existing loading state from useOptimizedFetch
  - Replace current loading skeleton with new standardized LoadingSkeleton component
  - Implement loading indicators for product search and category filtering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Integrate loading indicators in Craftsmen component
  - Modify Craftsmen component to use loading prop and show LoadingSkeleton during data fetch
  - Replace existing CraftsmenGridSkeleton with new standardized LoadingSkeleton component
  - Add loading state management for craftsmen data display
  - Ensure loading indicators work correctly with craftsmen filtering and search
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Add CSS animations and styling
  - Create CSS animations for spinner rotation using transform property for performance
  - Implement shimmer effect for skeleton components using background-position animation
  - Add responsive styling for loading components across different screen sizes
  - Ensure animations are smooth and don't cause layout thrashing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 9. Implement accessibility features
  - Add proper ARIA labels and roles to all loading components

- [ ] 10. Add error handling for loading states
  - Implement error boundaries for loading components to prevent crashes
  - Add retry functionality with loading indicators for failed requests
  - Create error states that maintain loading context and provide actionable solutions
  - Ensure proper cleanup of loading states when components unmount
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 11. Write comprehensive tests for loading components
  - Create unit tests for LoadingSpinner component testing size, color, and accessibility props
  - Write unit tests for LoadingSkeleton component testing different skeleton types and count
  - Create unit tests for LoadingOverlay component testing visibility and message display
  - Write integration tests for MainPage, ProductsGrid, and Craftsmen components with loading states
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 12. Optimize performance and finalize integration
  - Optimize CSS animations to use transform and opacity for better performance
  - Implement proper request cancellation in loading states when components unmount
  - Add debouncing to prevent excessive loading state changes during rapid user interactions
  - Ensure memory cleanup of loading timers and animations
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3, 4.4_
